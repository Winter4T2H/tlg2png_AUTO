# tlg2png_AUTO

Update 2025-02-02: This repo is now public. Any suggestions are welcomed.

> TLG images are used by games based on Kirikiri engine, which includes titles such as Fate/Stay Night and all of Yuzusoft's.

這是一個拿來簡化tlg2png的小腳本，純Python，為了我這種懶人寫的。
This is a simple script I wrote to automate tlg2png. Pure Python.

### 如何使用？How to use?

把要轉換的.tlg檔案放在與腳本同一個目錄下，執行腳本。
你應該會在 /export/ 內看到所有轉換成功的檔案(.png)

Put the .tlg file to be converted in the same directory as the script and execute the script.
You should see all the successfully converted files (.png) in /export/
